# NeuralPDE for AI4Science

This is a repository for the tutorial/coursework during HS2024 for the course [401-4656-21L  AI in the Sciences and Engineering](https://github.com/camlab-ethz/AI_Science_Engineering/) at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

In the course the provided tutorials are all written in python, this repository is following the tutorials in class, but using the Julia package [NeuralPDE.jl](https://github.com/SciML/NeuralPDE.jl) instead.

It serves as entertainment purposes. ðŸ˜‡
